This repository was used in my experiments for my final projects in APMTH220. 

Results are found in the folder titled "what_did_we_learn" 

Architecture is found in the file called "model.py" under the classes GraphMambaLayer and GraphMamba. These names are retained because GraphMamba was the baseline, even though I modified the code. 

Preprocessing and sequence creation are found in the file called "dataset.py" under the SubgraphDataset class. 

Datasets were from SubGNN. Data published here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zv7gw2bqzqev9yn/AACR9iR4Ok7f9x1fIAiVCdj3a?e=1&dl=0
